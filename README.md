#Password Generator

## Installation
This website is meant to generate a random password between 8 and 128 characters. These characters can be chosen from lowercase letters, uppercase letters, symbols (such as !, @, *, etc) and numbers 0 to 9. This done through a java script file using functions, arrays, loop functions, and API to get the whole program to run. 


## Usage
When a user opens the page, they are able to click on the red button labeled 'Generate Password'. A window will pop up to promp the user to choose a password length, as well as the style of the password (whether they want uppercase letters, lowercase, numbers, special symbols, or a medley of the four options). When the user has completed the window prompts, they should be given a random password of the specified list and style chosen. 

## Visuals
Below are screenshots of how the site functions both on the webpage and in the script.js file. A link generated by GitHub is also available below.

## Contributions
The html, css, and part of the javascript code was already coded by edX Boot Camps LLC. Heavy reference was taken from jwilferd10's script code on GitHub Here: https://github.com/jwilferd10/JavaScript-Password-Generator. Thanks to that example, I was finally able to understand what I was trying to code. I owe a lot of my understanding to him.
